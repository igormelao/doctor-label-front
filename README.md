Here, you can see your Next Case or the actual Case that you are working.

You can choose more than one Label for this cases and when you are able to get next case you click on button Next Case.

You only will be see next case when you click on this button, otherwise, you will keep see tha Case that you are working.

We believe that on some cases, you need to a break and that's why wee keep the Case with you if you starting labelling the case.
